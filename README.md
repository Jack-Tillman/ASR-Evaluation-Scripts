During the evaluation of 3 ASR providers, I created multiple python scripts to accomplish a variety of tasks, including: 
  * Normalize ground truth documents and returned transcriptions
  * Remove errors in transcriptions borne from minor inconsistencies and errors in ground truth document preparation
  * Format transcriptions into an easily readable format
  * Calculate Word error rate of transcriptions utilizing the werpy Python package ( https://pypi.org/project/werpy/ )
Considering I had minimal experience with Python before this project, I am pleased with how effective these scripts turned out to be :)
